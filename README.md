## Synergy

Synergy is a plugin that can create random animations based on a variety of parameters.

At its core, Synergy has the notion of _steps_ and _modifiers_. Each step can contain one or more modifiers, which are used to drive certain parameters such as forces on a rigidbody or morph values. A step has a _duration_, which is used to synchronise the modifiers. Once the duration has elapsed, Synergy moves on to the next step.
